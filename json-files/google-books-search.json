    "description": "Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape. In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world's top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they're fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You'll learn how to: * Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization * Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing * Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs * Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy * Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing For quick reference, \"Security Engineering Cheat Sheets\" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you're most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications that stand the test of time.",

Prior knowledge of developing web applications is required. You should have a working knowledge of both JavaScript and HTML. What You Will Learn Harness the power of D3 by building interactive and real-time data-driven web visualizations Find out how to use JavaScript to create compelling visualizations of social data Identify the purpose of your visualization and your project's parameters to determine overriding design considerations across your project's execution Apply critical thinking to visualization design and get intimate with your dataset to identify its potential visual characteristics Explore the various features of HTML5 to design creative visualizations Discover what data is available on Stack Overflow, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ Gain a solid understanding of the common D3 development idioms Find out how to write basic D3 code for server using Node.js In Detail Do you want to create more attractive charts? Or do you have huge data sets and need to unearth the key insights in a visual manner? Data visualization is the representation and presentation of data, using proven design techniques to bring alive the patterns, stories, and key insights that are locked away. This learning path is divided into three modules. The first module will equip you with the key techniques required to overcome contemporary data visualization challenges. After getting familiar with key concepts of data visualization, it's time to incorporate it with various technologies. In the second module, Social Data Visualization with HTML5 and JavaScript, it teaches you how to leverage HTML5 techniques through JavaScript to build visualizations. It also clears up how the often complicated OAuth protocol works to help you unlock a universe of social media data from sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. Once you are familiar with the concepts of incorporating data visualization with HTML5 and JavaScript, third module, Learning d3.js Data Visualization, will lead you to D3, which has emerged as one of the leading platforms to develop beautiful, interactive visualizations over the web. This module provides a strong foundation in designing compelling web visualizations with D3.js. By the end of this course, you will have unlocked the mystery behind successful data visualizations. This Learning Path combines some of the best that Packt has to offer in one complete, curated package. It includes content from the following Packt products: Data Visualization: a successful design process by Andy Kirk Social Data Visualization with HTML5 and JavaScript by Simon Timms Learning d3.js Data Visualization, Second Edition by Ǯdrew Rininsland and Swizec Teller Style and approach This course includes all the resources that will help you jump into creating interactive and engaging visualizations for the web. Through this comprehensive course, you'll learn how to create engaging visualizations for the web to represent your data from start to finish!",

This has resulted in heavy projects that are difficult to manage and scale. This book will explain a new way to write web applications by treating the front-end as if it were a third-party (such as a mobile client). This book, written by a practicing MEAN developer, will take a holistic approach to using the MEAN JavaScript platform for creating modern web applications and lay out how to use the MEAN (Mongo, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) set of tools to create a web application, from installation and setup of the tools to debugging and deploying your app. After an introduction to how web development is changing and the advantages of using the MEAN stack, the author jumps into an introduction to each tool and then dives into using the complete JavaScript-based application stack to build, test, and deploy apps.",

Four IBM experts offer practical, hands-on coverage of front-end development with IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5, IBM Worklight, and today’s most popular open source frameworks. Using well-crafted examples, the authors introduce best practices for MobileFirst development, helping you create apps that work superbly on mobile devices and add features on conventional browsers. Throughout, you’ll learn better ways to deliver Web 2.0 apps with HTML /JavaScript front ends, RESTful Web Services, and persistent data. Proven by IBM and its customers, the approach covered in this book leads to more successful mobile/web applications—and more effective development teams. Coverage Includes • Developing for MobileFirst: moving from “graceful degradation” to “progressive enhancement” • Quickly delivering lightweight JEE apps with WebSphere Application Server’s new Liberty Profile • Implementing an agile, user-centered, page-oriented approach to design • Constructing REST services with WebSphere Liberty, Eclipse, and JEE annotations • Building better front-end application architectures with frameworks and JavaScript • Designing and building complex, transactional RESTful services that interface with databases and other data sources • Building IBM Worklight hybrid apps with open source frameworks: jQuery Mobile, Backbone, Require.js, and Handlebars • Debugging cross-platform, multi-language modern web apps • Promoting scalability, security, and connectivity into the wider enterprise The IBM Press developerWorks Series pairs books with complementary resources on the developerWorks website at https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/dwbooks/",
